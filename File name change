# The file name "Splitted_11_12.txt" can be renamed to "11_12.txt", with this sample programme by using Windows Power Shell


get-childitem *.txt | foreach { rename-item $_ $_.Name.Replace("Splitted -", "") }


get-childitem *.txt
#list all txt files in the directory, which is then attached to another function "foreach" with | operator.

foreach { rename-item $_ $_.Name.Replace("Splitted -", "") }

#reolace Splitted - with nothing "".

## Its possible to use get-childitem to rename any files in the directory the same way, hence to trim the file names
